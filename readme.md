# SpellChecker

A project inspired by Peter Norvig's essay [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) written in modern C++ and tested with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

On average, running the correction function takes 1.4 seconds per 10 words.

```c++
int main() {
  SpellChecker checker("training.txt");

  std::cout << checker.correction("expresion") << std::endl; // expression
  std::cout << checker.correction("thea") << std::endl; // the
  std::cout << checker.correction("helpo") << std::endl; // hello
  std::cout << checker.correction("queot") << std::endl; // quote
  std::cout << checker.correction("peotry") << std::endl; // poetry
}
```

## How It Works

1. We read `word_freq.txt` in the SpellChecker's constructor and process each line, which contains an english word followed by a space and then the word's frequency.

2. Given a word the SpellChecker generates a set of possible correction candidates. This set is generated by taking words that are one and two edit distances away from the original word. This process produces a lot of words that would not be found in a dictionary so this set is filtered by all known english words.

3. We choose the most likely correction by finding the word that has the max frequency.
